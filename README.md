# UnrealPluginBuilder

Little tool that helps package a unreal plugin for multiple engine versions without the need of adding it to a project. 

## Instructions
- Place the executable where ever you want (The directory name should not be to long, otherwise packaging might not work, subfolder on Desktop is fine).
- Drop a plugin folder onto the executeable and follow the instructions.
- Packaged plugin will be output next to the executeable, on folder per version.
